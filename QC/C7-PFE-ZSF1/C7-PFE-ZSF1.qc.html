<h1>C7-PFE-ZSF1 RNA-seq Quality Control</h1>
<p>Deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) provides massive and valuable information about
functional elements in the genome. Ideally, transcriptome
sequencing should be able to directly identify and quantify all RNA species, small or large,
low or high abundance. However, RNA-seq is a complicated, multistep process involving sample
preparation, amplification, fragmentation, purification and sequencing. A single improper
operation would result in biased or even unusable data. Therefore, it is always a good
practice to check the quality of your RNA-seq data before analyses.

<p>Provided a BAM/SAM file and reference gene model, this module will calculate how mapped
reads were distributed over genome feature (like CDS exon, 5&#8217;UTR exon, 3&#8217; UTR exon, Intron,
Intergenic regions). When genome features are overlapped (e.g. a region could be annotated
as both exon and intron by two different transcripts) , they are prioritize as:
CDS exons &gt; UTR exons &gt; Introns &gt; Intergenic regions, for example, if a read was mapped to
both CDS exon and intron, it will be assigned to CDS exons.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;Total Reads&#8221;: This does NOT include those QC fail,duplicate and non-primary hit reads</li>

<h2>read_duplication<a class="headerlink" href="#read-duplication-py" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Two strategies were used to determine reads duplication rate:
* Sequence based: reads with exactly the same sequence content are regarded as duplicated reads.
* Mapping based: reads mapped to the same genomic location are regarded as duplicated reads. For splice reads, reads mapped to the same starting position and splice the same way are regarded as duplicated reads.</p>

<h2>read_NVC<a class="headerlink" href="#read-nvc-py" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This module is used to check the nucleotide composition bias. In ideal condition (genome is random and RNA-seq reads is
randomly sampled from genome), we expect A%=C%=G%=T%=25% at each position of reads.
It is perfectly normal to observe both a slight GC bias and a distinctly non-random base composition over the first 12 bases of the data. This is observed when looking, for instance, at the IVC (intensity versus cycle number) plots which are part of the output of the Pipeline. In genomic DNA sequencing, the base composition is usually quite uniform across all bases; but in mRNA-Seq, the base composition is noticeably uneven across the first 10 to 12 bases. 
Illumina believes this effect is caused by the "not so random" nature of the random priming process used in the protocol. This may explain why there is a slight overall G/C bias in the starting positions of each read. The first 12 bases probably represent the sites that were being primed by the hexamers used in the random priming process. 
The first twelve bases in the random priming full-length cDNA sequencing protocol (mRNA-seq) always have IVC plots that look like what has been described. This is because the random priming is not truly random and the first twelve bases (the length of two hexamers) are biased towards sequences that prime more efficiently.This is entirely normal and expected. 
This bias could be easily examined by NVC (Nucleotide versus cycle) plot. NVC plot is generated by overlaying all
reads together, then calculating nucleotide composition for each position of read
(or each sequencing cycle).

<p>NOTE: this program expect a fixed read length</p>

<p>According to SAM specification, if Q is the character to represent &#8220;base calling quality&#8221;
in SAM file, then Phred Quality Score = ord(Q) - 33. Here ord() is python function that
returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument
is a unicode object, for example, ord(&#8216;a&#8217;) returns 97. Phred quality score is widely used
to measure &#8220;reliability&#8221; of base-calling, for example, phred quality score of 20 means
there is 1/100 chance that the base-calling is wrong, phred quality score of 30 means there
is 1/1000 chance that the base-calling is wrong. In general: Phred quality score = -10xlog(10)P,
here P is probability that base-calling is wrong.</p>

genomic (DNA) size between two paired reads: D_size = read2_start - read1_end, then</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if two paired reads map to the same exon: inner distance = D_size</li>
<li>if two paired reads map to different exons:inner distance = D_size - intron_size</li>
<li>if two paired reads map non-exonic region (such as intron and intergenic region): inner distance = D_size</li>
<li>The inner_distance might be a negative value if two fragments were overlapped.</li>

<p>NOTE: Not all read pairs were used to estimate the inner distance distribution. Those low

<p>This program will compare detected splice junctions to reference gene model. splicing
annotation is performed in two levels: splice event level and splice junction level.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>splice event: An RNA read, especially long read, can be spliced 2 or more times, each time is called a splicing event; In this sense, 100 spliced reads can produce &gt;= 100 splicing events.</li>
<li>splice junction: multiple splicing events spanning the same intron can be consolidated into one splicing junction.</li>
</ul>
<p>All detected junctions can be grouped to 3 exclusive categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Annotated: The junction is part of the gene model. Both splice sites, 5&#8217; splice site
(5&#8217;SS) and 3&#8217;splice site (3&#8217;SS) can be annotated by reference gene model.</li>
<li>complete_novel: Complete new junction. Neither of the two splice sites cannot be annotated by gene model</li>
<li>partial_novel: One of the splice site (5&#8217;SS or 3&#8217;SS) is new, while the other splice site is annotated (known)</li>

<p>It&#8217;s very important to check if current sequencing depth is deep enough to perform
alternative splicing analyses. For a well annotated organism, the number of expressed genes
in particular tissue is almost fixed so the number of splice junctions is also fixed. The fixed
splice junctions can be predetermined from reference gene model. All (annotated) splice
junctions should be rediscovered from a saturated RNA-seq data, otherwise, downstream
alternative splicing analysis is problematic because low abundance splice junctions are
missing. This module checks for saturation by resampling 5%, 10%, 15%, ..., 95% of total
alignments from BAM or SAM file, and then detects splice junctions from each subset and
compares them to reference gene model.</p>
